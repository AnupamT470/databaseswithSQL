// Aggregate
Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations and return a single value.

The most common aggregate functions are:

COUNT(): returns the number of rows.
MAX(): returns the largest value in a column.
MIN(): returns the smallest value in a column.
SUM(): returns the total sum in a column.
AVG(): returns the average value in a column.

// # COUNT()
The first aggregate function we will learn is the COUNT() function. It's exactly how it sounds!

The COUNT() function counts the number of rows:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;

// min and max
MIN() and MAX() are exactly how they sound: they return the minimum and maximum value in a column, respectively.

For example, this returns the smallest value in the plays column:

SELECT MIN(plays)
FROM playlist;
.

This finds the most popular song in the table:

SELECT title, artist, MAX(plays)
FROM playlist;


// sum

SELECT SUM(plays)
FROM playlist;



//GROUP BY
The GROUP BY statement groups rows of data with the same values into buckets. Itâ€™s often used with aggregate functions to group the result by one or more columns.
